# Airflow Pipelines in Docker
This project contains few Airflow pipelines, each designed to fetch data from an API, store it in AWS S3, and then transfer it to different databases (AWS Redshift, Snowflake, PostgreSQL). The entire setup runs within Docker containers, making it easy to deploy and manage.
